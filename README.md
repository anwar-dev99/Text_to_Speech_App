## 🚀 Purpose

This project was originally built to easily and freely generate audio scripts for a phone application I was developing. It solved two main challenges: avoiding expensive commercial TTS services, and eliminating the need to manually run Python scripts each time to generate the texts.

This app provides a simple, instant way to convert text into speech and download high-quality MP3 files — **exactly what I needed** for my workflow.
